# NLP and Machine Learning: Language Model Deployment & Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
This project is part of the **Shadow Fox Internship Task**.  
The goal is to **deploy a Language Model (LM)** of choice, explore its inner workings, and perform a **comprehensive analysis of its performance and capabilities**.  

You can choose any LM ‚Äî ranging from **RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers, BERT, GPT-based models, etc.** ‚Äî and implement it for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task such as:
- Text Classification
- Sentiment Analysis
- Next Word Prediction
- Text Summarization
- Question Answering

## üöÄ Objectives
1. **Select a Language Model (LM):**
   - Choose any model (BERT, GPT-2, DistilBERT, XLNet, etc.)
   - Justify why you selected this LM.

2. **Implement the Model:**
   - Preprocess the dataset
   - Train or fine-tune the LM
   - Deploy for a downstream NLP task

3. **Analyze Performance:**
   - Compare with baseline methods
   - Evaluate with standard metrics (Accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, Perplexity, etc.)
   - Provide strengths and weaknesses of the LM

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks/Libraries:**
  - PyTorch / TensorFlow
  - Hugging Face Transformers
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn
- **Deployment (Optional):**
  - Streamlit / Flask
  - Gradio for model demos

## üìä Example Analysis
- **Dataset:** IMDB Sentiment Dataset
- **Model Used:** BERT (base-uncased)
- **Task:** Sentiment Classification (Positive/Negative)
- **Metrics:**
  - Accuracy: 92.1%
  - F1-Score: 91.7%
- **Observations:**
  - BERT captures semantic context better than RNNs/LSTMs
  - Higher computational cost and slower training
